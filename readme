EvilPhishing is a evil twin attack that redirects all the traffic to a local webserver with a phishing page. 

To use this script you'll need to install some dependencies, just run ./install 
to start the script, just type "./EvilPhishing". At the end of the script it will turn your system back to normal. 

* In case of the script crash without turning the files back to normal, you can just run the "./Back_to_normal" script to get everything back to normal.


====== Adding new phishing pages ======== 

1 - Open your browser 
2 - Go to the page you want to perform the phishing, 
3 - right clich and download the page to the folder "NewPage" 
4 - run the script "./NewPage"
5 - Put all the files, except the script, inside a folder with the name of the website
5 - Move that folder inside the "WebPages" folder. 
6 - run the ./EvilPhishing script

====== Using on a Raspberry Pi =========
